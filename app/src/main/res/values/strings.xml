        "Ingredients\n\n"

        "1 1/2 cups (225 g) unbleached all-purpose flour\n"
        "1/2 tsp baking soda\n"
        "Pinch salt\n"
        "3/4 cup (170 g) unsalted butter, melted\n"
        "1 cup (210 g) brown sugar\n"
        "2 tbsp sugar\n"
        "1 egg\n"
        "1 egg yolk\n"
        "7 oz (195 g) milk or semisweet chocolate, coarsely chopped\n\n\n"


        "With the rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line two or three baking sheets with parchment paper."
        "In a bowl, combine the flour, baking soda and salt.\n"
        "In another bowl, combine the butter and both sugars with a wooden spoon. Add the eggs and stir until smooth. Stir in the dry ingredients and chocolate."
        "Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour or overnight.\n"
        "Using a 3-tbsp (45 ml) ice cream scoop, spoon five to six balls of dough on each baking sheet, spacing them out evenly."
        "Bake one sheet at a time for 8 to 9 minutes or until lightly browned all over. They will still be very soft in the centre.\n"
        "Cool completely on the baking sheet."
